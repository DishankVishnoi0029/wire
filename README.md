2. **Choose the version**: Look for the latest version listed. It will usually be at the top.
3. **Download the file**: Click on the file that matches your operating system. For example, you might see links for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
4. **Save the file**: Your browser will ask you where to save the file. Choose a location you can easily find later, like your Downloads folder.

## üìÇ Installation Instructions

Once you have downloaded the file, follow these simple installation steps:

1. **Locate the downloaded file**: Go to the folder where you saved the downloaded file.
2. **Extract the contents**: If the file is zipped, right-click on it and select "Extract" or "Unzip".
3. **Open the terminal**: You might need to use a command line interface (CLI) to run wire. 
   - For Windows, search for `cmd` in the start menu.
   - For macOS, open `Terminal` from your Applications folder.
   - For Linux, you can find `Terminal` in your system menu.
4. **Navigate to the folder**: Use the command `cd` followed by the path to the folder containing the extracted files.
5. **Run the application**: Type `./wire` (or `wire.exe` on Windows) and press Enter. This runs the application.

## üîß Basic Usage

After installation, you are ready to use wire. Here are the steps to get you started:

1. **Create a new Go project**: Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project using `mkdir myproject`.
2. **Change to the project directory**: Use `cd myproject` to navigate into your new directory.
3. **Initialize a Go module**: Run `go mod init myproject` to set up the module.
4. **Create a wire.go file**: Create a new file called `wire.go` in your project directory. You can use a simple text editor to do this.
5. **Define your components**: In your `wire.go` file, you will need to define your application's components. This is where you tell wire how to manage your dependencies.
6. **Generate the code**: Run the command `wire` in your terminal. This command processes your `wire.go` file and generates the code needed for your application.

## üí° Features

- **Compile-time dependency injection**: wire handles dependencies efficiently at compile time, reducing run-time errors.
- **Code generation**: Automatically generates code, saving you time and effort in wiring dependencies.
- **Supports Go modules**: Works seamlessly with Go modules to keep your project organized.

## üìã System Requirements

To run wire, make sure you have the following:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, any updated version of Linux.
- Go version: At least Go 1.15. You can check your version by running `go version` in your terminal.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, consider the following:

- **Check Go installation**: Make sure Go is installed properly. You can confirm this by typing `go version` in the terminal. If you do not see a version number, reinstall Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **Path issues**: Ensure that your terminal is in the correct directory where wire is located.
- **Permission issues**: If you cannot run wire, try running the terminal with administrative rights.
